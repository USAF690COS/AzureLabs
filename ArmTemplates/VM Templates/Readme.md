# VM Templates Folder
ARM Deployment Templates Folder for individual VM deployments.

Each VM deployment is defined in the deployment template located in the corresponding VM name folder.
These deployments are dependent on resources created in the Deploy Lab template and are configured to be deployed as linked templates.

Deploying these templates directly may fail.
